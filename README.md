# Chaotic Image Encryption
This is the code repository for my final project in Chaotic Dynamics (CSCI-5446) at CU Boulder, written in the Spring 2015 semester.

The repo contains the implementation of three different encryption algorithms, and the code necessary for testing them. Analysis, information and references can be found in the [project report](https://github.com/nfejes/chaotic-image-encryption/raw/master/report/chaotic-image-encryption.pdf).
